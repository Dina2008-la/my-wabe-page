# Exporting your AI chat (Cursor / VS Code)

You must export your development AI chat as a Markdown (`.md`) file showing the conversation with the AI across the whole development process.

Cursor (or AI in VS Code):
- Open the chat panel in your editor where the AI conversation is recorded.
- Look for an "Export" or "Save conversation" option (usually in the chat menu or three-dots menu).
- Export as Markdown (`.md`) and save the file in your project root (e.g. `ai-chat-export.md`).

If using VS Code with a Chat extension:
- Open the chat history window.
- Use the export feature (some extensions provide it). If not available, select the conversation, copy-paste into a new Markdown file, and save as `ai-chat-export.md`.

Submission:
- Include the exported markdown file in your repository before submission.
- The file should clearly show the prompts and the AI responses used during development.
